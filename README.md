App with **Activity** and **Fragment** that allows _drag_ and _drop_ an **ImageView** (40x40 dp in size) contained inside **FrameLayout** (widht and height set to match_parent)

Position on **ImageView** is preserved, so on app restart or configuration change **ImageView** is set to the same position it has been _dragged_ to on last session.
After _drop_ **SnackBar** with 'success message' is showing.
